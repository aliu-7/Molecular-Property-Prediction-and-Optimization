In cheminformatics, selecting the right machine learning model often requires balancing predictive power, interpretability, and ease of implementation. Deep learning architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can uncover intricate patterns in molecular data, but they typically demand large datasets, significant computational resources, and specialized expertise.

Random Forests provide a practical alternative. These models are based on ensembles of decision trees—simple, rule-based classifiers that split data according to feature thresholds. While a single decision tree can easily overfit the training data, a Random Forest aggregates predictions from multiple trees built on different subsets of the data. This approach reduces variance and improves the model’s ability to generalize.

Random Forests are especially useful for molecular property prediction tasks where:

- Descriptors are already well-defined (such as molecular weight, topological polar surface area, or LogP)
- Interpretability is desired (to understand which molecular features influence predictions)
- The dataset is relatively small or contains noise

They are widely used in cheminformatics for problems such as blood–brain barrier permeability classification, solubility prediction, and drug-likeness scoring. Random Forests also require minimal preprocessing and can handle both categorical and numerical features, making them accessible to both chemists and data scientists.

In this chapter, we will explore how Random Forests operate, how to prepare molecular descriptors as input features, and how to evaluate and interpret the model’s predictions. The goal is to equip you with a reliable, interpretable, and reproducible method for making molecular predictions.

We begin by reviewing the structure and decision-making process of individual decision trees, followed by the ensemble principles that define the Random Forest model.
